# UFOs

## Overview of the Project

Create a webpage to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

To use the new wep page we created for Dana, we need to put the information that we want to look at in the new filters.

After writing the request in the filters (It could be one field or it could be more) The page will show the results as seen in image below

## Summary

As you can see, now we have more filters to look for more information on our webpage. However, one of the drawbacks is that the information put on the filtes is case sensitive, so you would need to put the information exactly as is dislpayed on the web.
